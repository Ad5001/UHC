The Author waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Modification.

  Downstream recipients.
    Offer from the Author – Software. Every recipient of the Software automatically receives an offer from the Author to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this License.
    Additional offer from the Author – the Modification. Every recipient of the Modification from You automatically receives an offer from the Author to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Modification under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
    No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Software if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Software.
    No endorsement. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Software is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Author or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  Other rights.
    Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Author waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Author to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
    Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this License.
    To the extent possible, the Author waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Author expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Software:

    for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
    if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Modification, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
    You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Author, to the extent possible, the Author offers the Software as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Software, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
  To the extent possible, in no event will the Author be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use of the Software, even if the Author has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
  This License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your rights under this License terminate automatically.

  Where Your right to use the Software has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    upon express reinstatement by the Author.
  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Author may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.
  For the avoidance of doubt, the Author may also offer the Software under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Software at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.
  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

  The Author shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Software not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this License.
  In the event that The License is updated/changed on the official github repository/on the official website, you automatically agree.
  The Author is not required to notify The User that The License has been updated/changed.

Section 8 – Interpretation.
  For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Software that could lawfully be made without permission under this License.

  To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
  No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Author.
Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Author or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
